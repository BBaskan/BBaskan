## About Me  
Throughout my journey from university to internships and professional work I’ve always faced challenges and limitations.  
Yet every time, I managed to overcome them by using the right tools, continuously learning, and improving myself.  

I know that in the future, there will always be areas I don’t fully understand yet, but I trust my ability to adapt, learn, and grow through them.  
In this vast ocean of knowledge that is computer science, I may have many things left to learn — but I believe deeply in my method, my curiosity, and my determination to reach my goals.  

Game development, for me, is not just a career opportunity it’s a lifelong passion.  
Since childhood, I’ve played and analyzed thousands of games to understand their **mechanics**, **aesthetics**, and the **intent behind their design**.  
Now, I aim to create experiences that carry that same creative energy — games that speak to players and leave a mark.
